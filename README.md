# TodoApp

Welcome to todoApp, a React Native app built with TypeScript that makes task management a breeze! This app works with a custom Ktor backend to ensure everything runs smoothly and scales nicely.

## Features

- **Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks:** Manage your tasks with simple, intuitive interactions.
- **Clean User Interface:** Enjoy a clutter-free experience that makes focusing on tasks easier.
- **Sync Across Devices:** Your tasks follow you on all your devices thanks to our custom backend.

## Features in Progress

- **MVP Enhancements:**
  - Note-taking capabilities within tasks.
  - Notifications to alert you when tasks are due.
  - Sharing task progress with friends or colleagues.
  - Categorization of tasks for better organization.
  - Conceptualizing how to allow users to assign tasks to others (still brainstorming this one!).

- **Animations Galore:** I'll be adding both subtle micro-animations and some major ones to jazz up your experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Expo & React Native:** For building a cross-platform mobile experience.
- **TypeScript:** For safe and predictable code behavior.
- **Firebase:** Handling user authentication like a boss.
- **Custom Ktor Backend:** my very own backend solution tailored to thy needs.
